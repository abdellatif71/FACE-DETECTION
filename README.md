Face Detection and Expression Recognition Using face-api.js
This project demonstrates a real-time face detection and expression recognition application using the face-api.js library. It captures live video from a webcam, detects faces, identifies facial landmarks, and recognizes facial expressions.

Features
Real-time face detection
Facial landmark detection
Expression recognition
Dynamic overlay on the video feed to display detection results
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

A modern web browser with webcam support
A local server to serve the files (e.g., using Node.js, Python's SimpleHTTPServer, or similar)
The face-api.js library
Pre-trained models for face detection, landmarks, recognition, and expressions, stored in a /models directory
Installation
Clone this repository or copy the code into a new directory.
Place the required pre-trained models in a folder named /models in the root directory. You can download the models from the face-api.js repository.
